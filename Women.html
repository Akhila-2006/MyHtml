        Introduction
        Women’s safety is a growing concern in today’s society. To ensure quick assistance in emergency situations, a **sensor-based safety button** can be a life-saving solution. This smart device allows women to send an immediate distress signal to authorities, family, or nearby help with just a press of a button.

        1. **Wearable & Compact Design:** The sensor button can be worn as a pendant, bracelet, or attached to clothing.  
        2. **One-Touch Activation:** When the button is pressed or triggered by a specific motion, it sends an alert.  
        3. **GPS Tracking:** Sends the exact location of the person in distress to pre-configured emergency contacts.  
        4. **Emergency Alert:** Sends an SMS, call, or notification to family, police, or a safety app.  
        5. **Sound Alarm (Optional):** A loud buzzer can be activated to alert people nearby.
