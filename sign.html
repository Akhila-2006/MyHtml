    <p>
        Sign language is a crucial mode of communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments. However, not everyone understands sign language, making communication challenging. To bridge this gap, sign language to text conversion technology plays a vital role in enabling effective communication between sign language users and non-sign language users.
        
        How It Works
        Hand Gesture Recognition: A camera captures the hand gestures and movements of the signer.
        Machine Learning & AI Processing: AI-based models analyze and interpret the gestures into meaningful text.
        Text Output: The recognized sign language gestures are displayed as text on a screen, making communication seamless.
        Applications
        Education: Helps students with hearing impairments in learning environments.
        Customer Service: Businesses can assist hearing-impaired customers more effectively.
        Healthcare: Doctors and nurses can communicate better with deaf patients.
        Everyday Communication: Breaks barriers in social interactions.
        With advancements in AI and deep learning, sign language translation technology is improving rapidly, making the world more inclusive for everyone.</p></div>
