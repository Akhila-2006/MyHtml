    This information tells us we need to focus on eating fresh foods that provide us with the nutrients our bodies need.
   Unfortunately, the food industry doesnâ€™t make as much of a profit on fresh foods; processed foods are where the money's at.
   Even big food companies have lobbied aggressively against public health plans - such as a campaign 
   ordering the removal of junk food from schools.These junk food items, processed from crops such as corn, wheat, 
   and soybeans, are high in calories (fillers) and lack the nutritional value your body needs. 
   However, because they are derived from crops, it can be difficult to know if they are healthy or not,
    and misleading claims on labels only make things worse.
